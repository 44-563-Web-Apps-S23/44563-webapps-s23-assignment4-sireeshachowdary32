            <h6>MISS Y.</h6>
            <h6>SCENE:</h6> 
            <p>_A corner of a ladies' restaurant; two small tables of
            cast-iron, a sofa covered with red plush, and a few chairs._</p>
       
            <h6>MRS.</h6>
             <p>X. _enters, dressed in hat and winter coat, and carrying a
            pretty Japanese basket on her arm_.</p>
            <h6>MISS Y.</h6> 
            <p>_has in front of her a partly emptied bottle of beer; she
            is reading an illustrated weekly, and every now and then, she
            exchanges it for a new one_.</p>
       
       <h6>MRS. X.</h6>
       <p> Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as
       lonely as a poor bachelor.</p>
       
            <p>[MISS Y. _looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes
            her reading_.]</p>
       
       <h6>MRS. X.</h6>
       <p> Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a
       restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as
       when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was
       reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
       witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end?
       Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going
       to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my
       dear.</p>
